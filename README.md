Multimodal AI Agent: A Cutting-Edge Solution for Analyzing Videos and Images Across Diverse Fields

During this holiday season, I’ve been working on the Multimodal AI Agent! This web-based hashtag#agent application leverages the power of AI to process and analyze both images and videos, providing insightful answers and generating actionable information across multiple domains. Whether you're in chemistry, architecture, calculus, or any other field, this AI tool is equipped to assist with your queries.

Key Features:

Video and Image Upload: Upload any video or image file (MP4, MOV, AVI, JPG, PNG, JFIF) for analysis.
Advanced AI Analysis: The AI evaluates the content and performs in-depth research to answer questions related to the visuals.
Multidisciplinary Support: The AI can assist with a variety of subjects, from scientific to architectural designs, and even mathematical equations.
Responsive & Intuitive Interface: A seamless experience where you simply upload your file and ask a question.
Whether you're working with chemical diagrams, architectural blueprints, or mathematical problems, this tool can help you make sense of your visual data, providing comprehensive, research-backed answers.

Tech Stack:

Streamlit: For building the interactive and user-friendly web interface.
Phi AI Agent: A robust AI framework hashtag#phidata for processing and analyzing content.
OpenAI/Google Gemini: For advanced AI-driven content analysis and research.
DuckDuckGo API: Integrated for performing web searches and fetching additional information.
Pillow: Used for resizing and processing images before analysis.
Python: The backend programming language powering the entire system.
This tool is designed to bridge the gap between visual data and actionable knowledge. A true game-changer for those who work with visual content and need quick, reliable insights.

If you're interested in exploring how this AI can transform your workflow, feel free to check it out or reach out to me for more details!




Here's an outline for the architecture of your Multimodal AI Agent app:

1. User Interface (UI) Layer
Framework: Streamlit
Page Configuration: Defines the page layout, title, and icon.
File Uploads: Allows users to upload videos or images for processing.
Text Inputs: Includes text areas where users can ask questions related to the uploaded media.
Results Display: Displays the AI-generated response, including text and analysis results.
Progress Indicators: Displays loading indicators when the model is processing the data.
2. Backend Logic Layer
File Handling:
Temporary File Storage: Uses tempfile for saving uploaded videos and images temporarily.
Image Resizing: Uses the Pillow library to resize uploaded images before analysis.
Video Processing: Uses the Google Generative AI API for uploading and analyzing video files.
AI Prompt Generation: The user's text prompt is integrated with the media content (video/image) to generate a meaningful request for the AI agent.
3. AI Processing Layer
AI Model (Gemini):
Gemini (Google's model) processes the uploaded video and image and generates relevant insights based on the user prompt. The agent works by running inference on the multimedia files (video/image) and analyzing their content.
Natural Language Understanding: Uses the combined strengths of Gemini and OpenAI models for advanced question answering, reasoning, and contextual analysis of the media.
Search API (DuckDuckGo): This tool is used to gather additional information if the AI needs to research any external data points to improve the analysis and answer the question.
4. External Services Layer
Google Generative AI API: Handles file uploads and video analysis.
The upload_file and get_file functions are used to manage the video analysis.
Gemini is the main model used to generate insights from the uploaded media.
DuckDuckGo API: Assists in gathering relevant external information when required by the AI Agent to improve the answers.
Web Research Integration: If the AI model needs external web research to back up its response, the DuckDuckGo tool is triggered.
5. Data Flow and Communication
User Interaction:

The user uploads an image or video and provides a question to the system.
Media Processing:

If the input is an image, it's resized and prepared for AI analysis.
If the input is a video, it is temporarily stored, uploaded to the cloud, and processed.
AI Analysis:

The AI model processes the visual content (image/video) and combines it with the user’s question.
It runs inference on the uploaded media and uses external research to enhance the output if needed.
Response Generation:

The AI Agent generates a comprehensive response to the user's question using both its analysis and relevant web search data.
Display Results:

The results are displayed to the user in the Streamlit interface.
6. Temporary Storage & Cleanup
Temporary File Management:
Video and Image Files: Uploaded files are stored temporarily using tempfile.
After processing, the temporary files are cleaned up to ensure no leftover data remains.
